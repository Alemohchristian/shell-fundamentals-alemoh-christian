### âœ… How It Works

- The menu is displayed in a while true loop to keep the program running.
- Tasks are stored in ~/todo.txt so they persist between runs.
- Tasks are numbered using nl so they can be deleted by number.
- New tasks are added using echo with >>.
- Tasks are deleted by line number using sed -i.
